Create a 2D top-down exploration game with the following features:

CORE GAMEPLAY:
- Player controls a sprite character viewed from above
- Movement using WASD keys (W=up, S=down, A=left, D=right)
- Hold spacebar for a speed boost
- Objective: collect food items while avoiding enemies
- No combat mechanics - survival through movement only
- When player collects food, the player body grows in a style similar to the snake in the classic Snake game
- The growing body should be uniform and look like made using Boolean union operation

WORLD:
- Procedurally generated environment
- World extends beyond initial screen view

COLLECTIBLES & HAZARDS:
- Food items scattered throughout the world (collectible)
- Enemy entities that patrol or move (must be avoided)

UI ELEMENTS:
- Display player's current world coordinates (x, y) in the top-left corner
- Coordinates should update in real-time as player moves

VISUAL STYLE:
- 2D sprites for player, enemies, and food
- Top-down perspective
- Clear visual distinction between player, enemies, and collectibles
- Procedurally generated background

Build this as a single playable application with smooth controls and clear win/lose conditions.
